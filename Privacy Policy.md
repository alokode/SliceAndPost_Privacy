Privacy Policy

Slice&Post ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle the information you provide while using our app.

Information We Collect Slice&Post does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or usage data. The app operates entirely on your device, and all processing of text occurs locally.

How We Use Your Information Since Slice&Post does not collect any personal or usage data, there is no information to use, share, or process beyond what is required to split your input text into smaller chunks.

Sharing Your Information We do not collect or share any of your information. All text you input into the app stays on your device and is not transmitted to any server or third party.

Security Your privacy and data security are important to us. Since the app processes text locally and does not store or transmit data, there is minimal risk to your information.

Third-Party Services Slice&Post does not integrate with third-party services or APIs. The app is standalone and does not interact with external systems.

Changes to This Privacy Policy We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected here, and the "Effective Date" will be updated accordingly. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically for updates.
